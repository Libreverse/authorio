# Change Log

## [v0.8.5](https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio/tree/v0.8.5) (2021-09-05)

This releases fixes a bug in the PKCE flow that was allowing failed checks to pass. Authorio
still supports "legacy" clients which don't use PKCE at all, but if a code_challenge is given
it is properly validated against the verifier.

## [v0.8.4](https://github.com/reiterate-app/authorio/tree/v0.8.4) (2021-08-18)

No new features in this release, but a major restructuring of the underlying code. In particular,
user profile URLs have changed. They are no longer specified explicitly per-user, but are instead
constructed on the fly via Rails' routing mechanics.

- User profile URLs are now handled via Rails resource routes (verify_user_url) 3a9ccac1d8c285a06d8a8daca1999978175386d0
- Fail early if token_request called with no token e082ac52b74cd11729eecaf9332181057e95b2e4
